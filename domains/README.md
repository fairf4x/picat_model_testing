# Domains

This directory should contain a directory for each domain we want to experiment with.
The directory structure can be created automatically by running:

```
# ./prepareDomain.sh <domain name> <pddl dir>
```

where `<domain name>` is name of the domain and `<pddl dir>` contain absolute path to directory with pddl domain and problem descriptions. The domain file has to be named *domain.pddl*.

## Directory structure for one domain

```
<domain>
 |- [problems] .. directory with Picat files with problem instances
 |- [models] .. directory with Picat domain models. Each model should contain string '###PLANNER###' where it calls the picat planner.
 |- [pddl] .. original pddl domain files. All files should be of type .pddl and domain should be named 'domain.pddl'
 |- mod_list .. list of models to use in experiment (listed without .pi extension)
 |- pla_list .. choice of Picat planners to use
 |- prob_list .. list of problem instances to use in the experiments
 \- <domain>_problems .. list of all problem files available (generated by runTranslator.sh)
```

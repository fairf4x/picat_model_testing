;;
;; The child-snack domain 2013
;;
;; This domain is for planning how to make and serve sandwiches for a group of
;; children in which some are allergic to gluten. There are two actions for
;; making sandwiches from their ingredients. The first one makes a sandwich and
;; the second one makes a sandwich taking into account that all ingredients are
;; gluten-free. There are also actions to put a sandwich on a tray, to move a tray
;; from one place to another and to serve sandwiches.
;; 
;; Problems in this domain define the ingredients to make sandwiches at the initial
;; state. Goals consist of having all kids served with a sandwich to which they
;; are not allergic.

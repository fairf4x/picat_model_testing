# Picat model testing
This repository contains a bunch of scripts for running experiments with planning domain models in [Picat](http://www.picat-lang.org/).

## Domain directory structure:

```
<domain>
 |- [problems] .. directory with Picat files with problem instances
 |- [models] .. directory with Picat domain models. Each model should contain string '###PLANNER###' where it calls the picat planner.
 |- mod_list .. list of models to use in experiment (listed without .pi extension)
 |- pla_list .. choice of Picat planners to use
 |- prob_list .. list of problem instances to use in the experiments
 \- <domain>_problems .. list of all problem files available (generated by get_instances.sh)
```
## Scripts:

1. `run.sh` - this script automatically runs all the experiments. If provided with list of parameters it runs experiments only for selected domains.
  e.g.:
  ```
  ./run.sh depots nomystery
  ``` 
  runs experiments only with *depots* and *nomystery* domains 
  
  *Parameters:*
  `CPU_CNT` .. number of parallel threads to launch
2. `run_one.sh` - this scipt is called by the **run.sh** script for each domain that is to be processed
  *Parameters:*
  `TIME_LIMIT` .. time limit for execution of one problem instance
  `MEM_LIMIT` .. memory limit for execution of one problem instance
3. `get_instances.sh` - script that cuts one long file with problem instances into individual problem instance files
